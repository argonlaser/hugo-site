I add 1's and 0's to the semiconductor industry. I don't stop with that. I contribute to open source projects particularly in javascript and go. I strictly believe that stable code must be optimized for performance improvements in terms of both space and time. I am a very passionate interested in developing software that could solve a real life problem or could entirely change a way something is used. I look for opportunities that fulfill my passion.
